NEW SQL FOR UUID-STATBLOBS
==========================

Formats
=======
Each blob is identified by a 36 byte UUID, this UUID is a 32 byte Java generated UUID, 
prefixed with 3 byte type id and _

The following type codes are reserved for use by BeardStat in the roles defined to them. It is required that plugins that extend BeardStat follow these guidelines when using stat blobs of these types.

name   - type name - UUID prefix
Player - PLAYER    - PLY_
Group  - GROUP     - GRP_
Plugin - PLUGIN    - PLG_
World  - WORLD     - WRD_
Global - GLOBAL    - GBL_

Player :: The same stats as used in 0.4.8, Any statistics that relate specifically to a player (games won, x's killed)

Group :: Stats related to a group (territory owned, wars waged)

Plugin :: Plugin related stats (warzones played, total kills in an area, IC's created)

World :: Stats about a world (creepers alive, enderbro's slayed)

Global :: Server specfic stats (players online etc)
