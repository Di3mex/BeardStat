<h3>Player Statistics for the modern bukkit</h3>

<p>BeardStat provides simple, yet powerful recording of player statistics (blocks mined, creepers killed, deaths by drowning, play time, last login, how much xp you've collected.).</p>

<p>Recent new additions to BeardStat include shearing, dyeing and crafting stats (crafting stats are broken due to a bukkit bug, will update as we find which build it's fixed in :) ), alongside improvements to make it easier and better.</p>

<p>BeardStat provides  MySQL and flatfile (yml) as storage mechanisms for statistics.</p>

<p>Available since Grapefruit, we provide a web API, allowing you to integrate BeardStat into your website, with detailed stats breakdowns, top tens</p>

<p>BeardStat is also easy to work. Plugins can add their own custom stat collectors (such as breaking a block with a specific tool, or trying shear a creeper). <a href="http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/beardach/">BeardAch</a> utilises BeardStat's API to provide statistic based achievements, alongside many other triggers.</p>

<h2>Grapefruit is here! Twice the taste, half the calories!</h2>
