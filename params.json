Plugins can add their own custom stat collectors (such as breaking a block with a specific tool, or trying shear a creeper). [BeardAch](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/beardach/) utilises BeardStat's API to provide statistic based achievements, alongside many other triggers.\r\n\r\n##Grapefruit is here!
